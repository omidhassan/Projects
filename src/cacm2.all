machin calcul of moment of a probabl distribut
a method is present for the calcul on a

necessit littl more than n addit and n refer
to memori for each moment
instead of the
minimum of n multipl
2n addit
and 2n refer
to memori requir by the most straightforward
method
where n is the number of entri in the probabl

the method is directli applic

case it conserv both time and accuraci

the design of a comput system should adopt
explicit criteria for accept or reject
propos system featur
three possibl criteria of thi
kind ar input record
input specifi

and asynchron reproduc of output
these criteria
impli that a user can
if he desir
either
know or control all the influenc affect the content
and extent of hi computs output
to defin
the scope of the criteria
the notion of an abstract
machin of a program languag and the notion
of a virtual comput ar explain
exampl of applic
of the criteria concern the read of
a time
of

the synchron of parallel
process
protect in multiprogram system

and the assign of capabl index
.I1748
a schedul philosophi for multiprocess system
a collect of basic idea is present

the notion of process and state vector ar discuss

the structur of the the

a multiprogram system is describ in
which all activ ar divid over a number of
sequenti process
these sequenti process ar place
at variou hierarch level
in each
of which on or more independ abstract have been

the hierarch structur prove
to be vital for the verif of the logic sound
of the design and the correct of it implement

the work set model for program behavior
probabl the most basic reason behind the absenc

in thi paper a new model

the work set

these subexpress can be evalu

thi paper show that express execut

in particular

subexpress should be execut in order of decreas

thi
observ is valid for configur rang from

if the

it is conclud that thi

thi paper report upon the lesson
learn from the oper of the network over the past
two year
a major impact of the network wa
not so much the comput power deliv to the school
as the awaken of comput awar and the
foster of capabl develop at these school
the
expertis and assist from the central facil
as well as the share of idea among the particip
were other import benefit
both the qualiti
and varieti of servic provid by the central facil
were found to plai a kei role in the effect

a region network bring mani benefit
